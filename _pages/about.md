I am currently an Associate Professor in the **School of AI and Advanced Computing** at [Xi’an Jiaotong-Liverpool University](https://www.xjtlu.edu.cn/). I received my Ph.D. from the **University of Nottingham** under the supervision of [Prof. Guoping Qiu](https://www.nottingham.edu.cn/en/about/university-leadership/university-leadership.aspx) in 2018. Before that, I earned my **M.Sc. degree from the University of Edinburgh** in 2013. My main research interests include **Digital Pathology, Computational Pathology, and Image Processing**, with a strong intersection in **Computer Vision and Machine Learning**.
